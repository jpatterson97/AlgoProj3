> This is the itsy bitsy spider maze project. This code will take in the start point end point and the levels rows and columns. It will take this from an input file input.txt. After it reads this in it will create an adjacency matrix where the sets of 6 binary digits will be the vertices and the edges will be created when there is a 1 stating that direction of the edge. It will then go through the graph traversing it and find a path. 

## Setup
Just use basic command to run
g++ *.cpp -o Maze
